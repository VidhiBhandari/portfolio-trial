<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey i'm Vidhi, im basically a fun person but can sometimes be annoyed with me also, akthough i love reading books and 
  that can possibly be one of the reasons of you not liking me cuz i tend to love my books more than a singular person so 
  yeah well thats that.</p>

<p>So coming back to why im making this web page its probabily cuz i wanna know what i like and what i hate the most and till 
  now i love working here talking to people and getting a hands on experience of thats out there in the real world so well yeah
</p>

<p>My odd interest in wasting my time and others is also a cool aspect of me working on this site, i know i'll probabily 
  work only when the environment is suitable enough for me to work on and the comfort level that i'm in but yeah, im currently
  loving my internship 
</p>
